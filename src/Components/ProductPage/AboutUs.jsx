        Urban Touch is an award-winning social enterprise created to disrupt the
        cycle of poverty in Malaysia. We empower artisans from marginalised
        communities to produce fair fashion, home goods and accessories made
        from a traditional fabric called 'batik Malaysia'. <br /> <br /> We work with rural
        and urban touch artisans across Malaysia to create batik textiles on
        natural fibres. This fabric is then sent to the seamstresses at our
        training centre to create products in designs that you'll love. <br /><br /> Through
        this model, we are able to alter the circumstances of marginalised
        communities by providing employment opportunities, sustainable incomes,
        and skills to achieve financial independence. <br /> To date, we have worked
        with over 300 artisans and impacted the lives of more than 1,500 local
        beneficiaries. <br /><br /> You can feel good knowing each purchase directly benefits
        the artisan who handcrafted the products and helps weave change in the
        lives of their families and communities. We area a 501(c)3 registered
        non-profit with EIN 45-5620649. <br /> Urban Touch is a proud winner of the
        MaGIC Amplify Award for Social Enterprise, watch our story.
